# /r/LEGO Community Flair

Welcome to our open-source community flair system! Here, you can create your own flair and submit them to the /r/LEGO mod team, where they can quickly review and approve your submissions.

This is an experimental system designed to give creative control of /r/LEGO flair directly to the community, with minimal quality control work required by moderators to approve community ideas.

Hopefully, this will greatly lower the amount of time between flair ideas, and implementation.

Feel free to submit any issues with either the software, or the idea directly here in GitHub.

# How To Contribute

1. Check out a copy of the working code using git or the GitHub app.
2. Modify the files located in /data as you see fit.
3. Submit your changes as a pull-request.

# Questions / Comments

Please use the issues system on this page to submit any questions or comments. The /r/LEGO subreddit is for LEGO discussion, and this system does not qualify as actual LEGO discussion.
